  Warren Buffet attributes much of his success to winning the "ovarian lottery" at brith. The chance of an arbitrary baby in 1930 being a white male in the United States was less than 5%. Today, the chances are even smaller. Ask any reasonable person who has been successful, however you choose to define it, and they will surely tell you that much of their success comes from sheer luck. A physicist might say how lucky she is that the Universe is so nicely fine-tuned. An entrepreneur might say how lucky she was to meet her cofounder at a party. An athlete might say how lucky she is to enjoy spending time alone practicing or to have avoided major injuries. At whatever scope, from prehistoric to personal, there are many lucky occurances outside of our control that create each and every one of us as we are. Without getting too philosophical, we can say with decent confidence that success is overwhelmingly a by-product of luck, and that our decisions and actions contribute a tiny amount at most.

  Regardless of whether we believe in God or chance or something in between, this perspective is liberating and useful to keep in mind. It releases us from the burden of achieving success under our own steam and it shows us the privileges of life that the Universe has afforded and for which we can be grateful. An ambitious mind that adopts this perspective will no longer be preoccupied with that which cannot be controlled, instead focusing attention and energy on the actions  maximizing the contribution from that sliver of personal control we have over our own destiny

   ourselves to maximize the likelihood of success.
